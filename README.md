# LV-Protobuf-RAW
A low level protobuf encoder and decoder.

This LabVIEW library allows the encoding and decoding of protobuf message buffers. 

It does NOT provide a parser or any code generation abilties needed to handle .proto definitions. But if you know what you do, you can implement messages by yourself.

A generator is worked on but is not useable by now. It will be published in another project, if ever.
